Advice to Parents
From the moment I was born you told me a no
Sometimes a yes, but mostly a no
From playing into the dirt to staying outside
I’ve never been able to plan my own ride
Now it’s time for me to give you some advice
And no, it’s not something dumb like be more nice
Listen and understand do not brand
You don’t listen to what I have to say
And understanding will get you a long way
All you do is put on brands, and giving chances can win you grands
Listen to what I tell you, don’t believe all they sell you
I’ve seen you from the playground the manipulation that you face
But don’t run from the unusual try and chase
Do what you weren’t able to so long ago
Be a team don’t tow, row
It’s never to late to try and be great 

I am sobbing, you smile, I laugh.
You are my hideout where I can store my secrets and dreams
You are the person I am myself around
I don’t need to fake anything
Our friendship is the ship that sails through storms of school
Icebergs of mean girls 
And can shoot down any ship of envy or dispute
We know the weirdest things about eachother
And love each sleepover where we stay up talking till 4
If you were chased by a wild dog, I’d throw a bone as diversion
Pricked by a thorn, I’d pretend to be a doctor
And punched by someone, I’d throw a beehive at him
Thank you for bearing my giggles, my tears, and my nonsense times, you truly are my BFF.

Dear Inspiration
When you came to me, I pushed you away
Every. Single. Day
You didn’t give up, I wonder why?
Maybe because that’s not the way you wanted me to die
Without passion, without fulfillment
And finally when I gave in
You filled every inch of my head 
And soon enough my imagination was no longer dead
Everywhere I spoke you, revoked you
You never strayed, but stayed
Feeding my limbs with the fire they needed
Approving every word I wrote
Thank You for not giving up on me

Devoured By Faith
It came to me one day, flew through the crack in the window, drifted in through 
the door left ajar. It was much at first, only a gust to dry my tears, but then it 
swirled, twirled, and whirled, spinning around its prey. Until it found me, or rather
 I opened to it, and it opened my heart bit by bit, covered my mind little by 
little, and soon everything seemed clear. Because all my wandering, searching for 
the truth was finally over. I had found faith, and it had found me.
To the Fortunate
Hello cheerful little dolly
Welcome to the world of happiness and love
Is that what they said to you when you were born?
No, because not all of us bathe in money, not all of us have beds made of love
Most of us have to face the real world full of sadness’s and sorrows 
Deaths and defeat
We have joy but in the form of a broken toy
So please all I am saying, is have some sympathy for the less fortunate
Not all of us have things like you
The worlds not all sunshine and rainbows
Its stormy and thunder reigns supreme
But if you are one of the lucky
Then help someone run through the rain
From a Celebrity
You think I walked on a rainbow to get here
You think I get a pot o’ gold everyday
You will never know how much of me I’ve sold
My life built of lies
Lookin’ like beauty in your eyes
You haven’t seen the real me
The one that’s as solid as a grown tree
I have feelings you know
You may not see em’ 
But they’re there
Don’t just look at my thrice died hair
Help me
I wanna show the real me
My bark now dark 
From all my hidin’
Please enough bidin’
Its time for me to share my story
Don’t mistake me for just another tree in the forest
I am not the bleakest but the boldest
Don’t Chop me down
Overlook me
But help me grow
I am Somebody
Who is Denying
The REALITY
I am somebody
Who is Testing
The LIMITS
I am somebody
Who is Defying
The NORM
I am somebody 
Who is…
The one chicken that learns to FLY
I am not Someone’s Costume
I am not a disguise
I am not just something you can win as a prize
I am something of value, not just to amuse your eyes
I am something of promise, not for you to enslave
I am not to be caged like a pet, but free like a man
I am not to be thrown into this deep dark cave, working night and day with no pay
I am not to be worn by anybody nor cornered into being a nobody
Because I am not a prop, a doll or a display.
Because I shine brighter than the sun’s ray
I am a diamond just waiting to shine
Because this costume is mine
Our Friendship
Our friendship is like a candle
Gentle, warming, beautiful
It lights up the dark and gives warmth 
But be reminded,
Forget this candle and it will burn your house down
I Believe in a World of Truth
Where the phrases ‘I didn’t do it’ and ’that’s not me’ are acknowledged
Because every time they avoid us because of that last bombing we say ‘that wasn’t us’ 
Or when they destroy families and corrupt the innocent we say ‘I didn’t do that’ 
But all they do is scowl and glare
Not a single moment goes by where I don’t think 
Why?
Why can’t we show them a world where they can finally see the difference between them and me?
Can’t the truth prevail?
To long it has been in hiding
Work for a world of truth too
Medicines for Impurities 
Expectance of Abundance corrupts, yet forgiveness cures
Falsehood and Deception injure, yet Trust heals
Racism and Injustice destroy, yet harmony and equality repair
Birth the Good, Amend the Bad
I am Ammarah
In Old Greek I am an unfading flower. In Sanskrit I am a chief and commander. In 
the African language of Igbo I am God’s grace. In Ethiopia I am named beautiful. In
 Latin I am love and in Spanish I am imperishable. In Germany I am enduring and I 
am a shooting star in India. In Hebrew I am kindness and grace. And even beloved 
in Latin. I am a princess of peace and a pomegranate flower. I am named after a 
protector of a prophet who fought battles valiantly. I am also a city in Iraq and a 
lake in Romania. But more importantly I am Ammarah. No matter how you want 
to spell it or pronounce it that is me. But I know that I am all that my name says 
and more. I was born to endure, to lead and to battle for what I stand for. From 
the moment I was Ammarah I knew. I am not an everyday; I 
am an Ammarah, beautiful and unique like an unfading flower. I will push through 
the storms and live my name, I will endure the tests and trials and maintain my 
kindness all the way through. Like a shooting star I will shine light through the 
darkest of times and like a leader and chief I will guide my people too. I will try my 
best to show grace and as much as I am able to protect those I care about in 
whatever way I need. I am not scared to hold a sword and keep my head high, 
because like a shooting star I will light the right way, like a princess of peace I will 
stand for what is right, like love I will spread my clear message, and like an 
unfading flower, I will bloom in the wrath of a storm. Because my name is 
Ammarah and Ammarah is who I am.
My Life is a Film
With a beginning and an end.
With Villains and allies.
And deceiving friends.
Its script is a tangle of feelings and thoughts.
Its sorrows bring tears that fill up pots.
Yet it shows joys and victories.
Made up of real stories.
It has its adventure and destructions.
But doesn’t dwell on reductions.
My film is coming and though not famous it’s one of a kind
My Querencia
When my foot hits the ball, slicing through the air and landing on the soft green 
grass. When I feel the air against the fabric of my hijab. The crisp, frigid freezing 
my cheeks and icy, pale pink. The rain glistening my skin drop by drop, daring me 
to test my limit, break my boundary, do the impossible. My Querencia not 
somewhere where I feel threatened or forced but free. I feel alive running against 
the wind and lashing rain, my cleats piercing the ground below. My 
breathing steady yet my heart racing faster than a mustang. And as my shoe hits 
the ball, I surpass my limit, flood my boundary, I shoot and… I score.
Polluters
You say you better the economy
You say you care for the land 
But we all can see past your net of lies
All you care about is the money
Cutting trees by the dozen
Extinguishing the last bit of life
Saying you clean the air
You wear masks to help you breathe
And when we came with seeds
You ground em up with your chemicals
To make them somehow edible and appealin’
Lock up your machines and pack up your tools
You all are crazy fools
For we need this earth to live in
Passion
Bright as the light in Edison’s workshop
Is your passion
Waiting to be discovered, released
Able to give light in the darkest
And show you what you can do at your greatest
Let your passion blaze through the darkness of the common
The Cure to Cancer
The air in my hair
Looking out the car’s window 
Until suddenly,
Horns, Loud, Unnerving
Mom, Unaware of the passing truck
Crash.
Blood, lots of it, Screams, even more
Sirens, close by, Shouting, near us
Then 
Darkness
My eyes open
Heavy and slow
Scarlet dripping from my arm
Lights, Bright 
White coats everywhere
Clipboards, orders, doors
I am plopped onto a soft bed
Machines beep
‘Vital signs are fine’


Mom and dad walk in
Eyes wet
Mom in a wheelchair
Badly bruised
Doctor smiles
‘One last check’
Nodding, they leave
Stethoscope, Otoscope, Popsicle stick
More machines, brighter light
Nurses leave
Doctor begins
Everything perfect
But then, his eyes flash
He swallows, audibly
He jabs a red button
Nurses rush in
Beeping gets louder
Shouts stronger
Darkness again

My eyes open
Groggy
Unaware of my surroundings
I try and get up
Pain
I fall back down
My parents come in
Doctor whispers to them
Tears Flooding
They leave
And the doctor walks to me
‘June’
‘Yes’
‘You have Thyroid Cancer’
It couldn’t be
No
I pinched myself
Not a dream
It couldn’t be, but it was



Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer
Worst case we’ve seen
Cannot be cured with modern medicine
Incurable 
Definite death
Last days
The hospital 
Now my sad home
White lights everyday
Nurses every hour
Torture every minute
Soon,
Minutes to hours
Hours to days 
Days to weeks
Closer to my last day
I was lost
In the realm of the unfaithful
I didn’t know which way to go
Which way to turn
When my life would end
When the cancer would take over
My hope was running out
My optimism gone
Faith lost
Until…
I prayed
To the one who had been watching me
The one who made me who I am
The God that I had forgotten
The only one who had the cure
I prayed
For my life
To cure the cancer
To give me faith

And as soon as I finished
Loud beeping
More doctors, more nurses
Checking machines
Disbelief masking every face
‘It’s a miracle’
And it was
The incurable had become the cured
The unfaithful had become the believer
And the Impossible had become possible
I had found faith, or rather, it had found me.             
The Eclipse of Mind
As she settled in, only to see the eclipse, as she shut her eyes her palm grew a 
lotus. The firelight flared ready to ignite and her eyes held tight to the fading 
velvet light. Her mind was a hide pelted with words of humiliation, imagination,
 and mockery. Had it all been a fantasy? Her eclipse of mind.
The moon on the day I was born…
Celebrated, for it had seen
The birth of a rising queen
Gifted, a heavy torrent to nature
Lifted, the nightmare tides
Foresaw, the sadness’s, the sorrows
Rejoiced at the triumphs, the feats in the morrows
Beckoned for the stars and the comets to see
The birth it was rejoicing, the birth of me.
The Three Mirrors                                                                                                                   By Ammarah. Siddiqui
The first mirror, shiny and clear its silver trim and illusion, made solely from 
deceitful eyes. The strangers regard to this, their favorite mirror of all. Judging by 
reflection as shallow as skin, paper thin, unbeknownst to what’s hidden deep, 
inside the abyss of the soul.
The second mirror, seen by close friends and family, is a reflection of your flesh, 
your blood, deep but not deep enough. Entangled midst the nests of lies that 
reside in its frame lies the egg of honesty. Not hatching nor intending to, only a 
single crack against the shell of trickery. Smiling and nodding you appear through 
its glass though inside you’re stiff as stone. They think they know everything 
about you, every secret, every dream, but this mirror too was born to disguise.
The third mirror, the one that belongs to only two God and you. No matter how 
much you pretend this mirror knows you from head to toe. Every fault, every flaw, every dream, every desire it can see. Whether it be who you envy to whom 
you pretend and aspire to be. This mirror was born to the true and is the only one 
who can see the real you. Running deeper than flesh, blood, or skin but to your 
heart, your soul, your being. Shine and polish this mirror as best you can because
 if it darkens, rusts, or cracks the other mirrors will divert their tracks, they will 
falter, fall and eventually shatter. And everyone will know who you are. Show 
what you want in each mirror but this one has a truthful mind of its own. But 
know, the third mirror balances it all, let it fall and you will show the world who 
you truly are. Make that a reflection worth seeing. 
The Barrier of Achievement
 It can limit even the best. For its bricks are molded from self-doubt and clay of
 giving up. For these who have built this wall around them would be able to do so 
much more if they just cracked, surpassed, destroyed this barrier, this wall. 
Because it must fall for if it does success will come flooding in, and drown defeat. 
And though some bricks may stop it, achievement will still trickle, drip, from the 
cracks in this unwanted barrier. Break this barrier, crack this wall. Let it fall.
One Time Round
 Live your life with value, live your life with love, try your best in everything you do.
 
 Laugh the fun, cry the sad, try and fight the bad. Be wild like a child, but shine your values like a precious gem. 

Live in the moment, savour every one of them. 
Establish ties, fend off lies. Experience joy, not shame! Live up to your name.
 
 Smile in the face of danger. Help out every stranger. 

 If you fall down don’t forget to stand up, and never, ever give up.
Live your life, you only got one time round.

 
Feminist High
 
I see every color on the flip side of the rainbow, cardboard signs raised in silent plea, 
equality
We are the feminists, those radical, loose screw girls who dream of a future where her figure is not the plot of the story.
Her conscience acknowledged. 
 
We are blondes and brunettes'
women with scarves on our heads
redheads on fire - 
we rise, 
for the hope that the future can be a better than the bitter past. 
We may be bruised but never broken, 
hurt but healing, 
drunk on dreaming - 
we rise. 
 
Tear gas rains down but we were crying long before, 
we remember our stories and its time you hear them. 
our ears have heard catcalls from miles away - 
so today, we stay. 
 
So break us, 
make us, 
we shall not back down. 
Speak for our bodies 
and each wear our crowns. 
We are queens of this world, with kings right beside. 
Join us in this feminist high.

Hunched 
Paper and pen
Eyes glued to

Remember,
You are amazing
Forget stargazing
You're going to touch them

Back bent
Over dress hem
 Creating creations 
Fit for 
Sleeping Beauty

There are few who were born to the clouds
Too dreamy
For Earth's monotony
Barely make it out of
Career class
With a pass
Because just
One path
Can't
Define me

Take the moon and the sun
Tie them up with a bow
Because robotics is fun
But so is getting to know
Everyone
Everything
Every fibre

And when they call you names

You ask them
Wouldn’t it be boring
If our souls weren't 
Soaring

When Love Arrives
It doesn’t warn you
Give you a caution sign
This won't be as divine
As your YA fantasy

No, 
Love 
Is tricky
Understatement
Love 
Is crazy

One minute you're wishing the lonely away
The next you wish you could stay
Without them
Thrive 
Even survive
On your own

But you're 
A sunflower
And they're

Lust was so
Fun
But love,
Love's the crazy one

Cheeks pale with bubblegum scrawls
We filed in car after car
20 in the 5 seater
Who needs a heater?
 
Uncle driving to the beat of the music
Back and forth
Electric lights emitting a steady thrum
 
Midnight struck
But we're in luck
The restaurant opened right back up seeing our
Fully loaded truck
 
Long table 
Filled end to end
Clamor and chatter 
Friendly banter
As sharp winds make rooftop bulbs shiver
 
Stars above
Envy the love
As the dish exchanges hands
Steaming and gleaming
The karai is beaming
Such attention for the main event
 
Only one bite of the one food
But I've never tasted anything so good
Meets my tongue
Spicy and sweet
Beef melts 
In the beat of the heat
 
Howling wind against my face
Its jealous of the bite and how I ate
The naan comes too
Crispy and true
Mama's here
And every uncle and aunt too
 
My cousin jumps from lap to lap 
Track star
At 3 and a half
 
Second bite even better
I can taste the chili
Silky curry
Pale bread a tongue sweater
 
Newlyweds at one of the ends
15 year old and her new best friends
50 years together sits across
Beside the 5 year old learning to floss
 
And karai
Centerpiece
Shining and smilin
From masala to bohti
Naan acting superior to the
Roti
 
The moon winks
And a star blinks
Begging blatantly
For a taste
 
And to be part 
of this family.

Key Lime Pie
 
Children develop tastebuds early in life
Preferences and favorites
No bananas
Candy is good
Yogurt amazing
As one should
But at 7 months 
My uncle decided 
Lets let her try
Key
Lime
Pie
Yeah the one with the sweet meringue
And surprise sour gem
And most children
Don’t like sour food
I was one of these children
So when
Key 
Lime
Pie
Touched my lips
I made a face that went down in history
A mix between
Horror and betrayal
Sweet fear of 
Sour pain
Never have I ever
Eaten
Key
Lime
Pie
Again.

I've been wandering
These empty halls
Chasing after
The slightest spark
-
Fallen prey to fleeting whispers
Tempting tugs
For an eternity
-
Tell me,
How can you get lost in someone's eyes,
When they're not even looking at you?
And how can you be blind to someone who-
Doesn’t need anything but you?
When your whole life 
You've been searching
For love
-
Stored lonely tears,
Jug after jug
Snow globes on the shelf
Cracked glass for
Crooked memories
Who'd love someone like me?
-
Midnight walks
Late night talks
Would it be too much?
-
Can't we just dance 
Under the stars
As constellations realign
We'd brave the dark
Hand in hand
Sipping sunshine
-
And when dawn breaks
We wouldn’t part
For I cannot loose
Another piece 
of my heart

I once climbed a ladder into the sky
To bring back divine pieces of heaven
But the angel saw through my silky lie
And sent me toppling down through all seven
-
I once climbed a ladder into the sun
To bring back sweet secrets of summer love
But alas ablaze I came back as one
Life so lonely, an omen, from above
-
I once climbed a ladder into the moon
To bring back potions for wandering souls
But my mind was lost in the dark side's tune
Left on the floor are my ladder and goals
-
I now build my own rungs, honest and strong
For what I did need, I had all along

In thy clearing laden with lavender
Decays lonely my heart in your basket
My fresh crimson blood marks this calendar
Of the day you stole my priceless casquet
-
Sweet breeze ruffles thy locks, dreamy caress
Yet your love is dark wine, never plenty
Eyes wander far, yet your hand shan't digress
Roses in my quarters from your gentry
-
Poppies praise your lust for aimless conquest
I too wish my sword through thy beating heart
Ballroom dancing, your hands on my back rest
I wish I never played this princess part
-
Pray me a sunflower, void of your sun
This poison pull a drug, to which I run
-
WHITE OWL
White owl
Hear my call
I’ve lost the will to live
Kind of fell apart
My son is gone
And so am I
My spirit lost
To the mountain high

I’ll help you,
But you must be strong
If we are to fix
This deadly wrong

We must make you lighter
That heaviness you feel
Of grief
And
Fear

Greet each new day
Cleanse and bathe
The pain will fade
Losing someone
Made you sick
But this self-healing
Will do the trick.

White owl 
Hear my call
I’ve lost the will to live
Kind of fell apart
But I greet each day
And protect my spirit
For I shall live
Each day with merit
I pass a thorn ridden field of ruby roses, an omen?
The trees tremble in anticipation
Thunk, clunk, a concrete crack- suitcase wheels catch – lock, yank
The world, bitch that she is – continues to run the clock 
Control towers and flashing vests enter my vision
Time for the adventure to begin

The sandy beach was like a cloud beneath my feet
A feeling, I’m reeling with joy, as waves sweep the shore
The setting, a scene straight out of a Disney movie
The gentle breeze sang a soft melody

A blink of pink, on the brink of dusk
The soft sky, a serene sight
Endless, boundless, my eyes see worlds away
In comparison, my mind, a still oasis

Puffin wings flutter by
Wings beating as one through the air, slicing through to the darkness
Clouds of white lie peacefully
In heaps of frigid solemnity 
An icy heap invades my heart, 
I never meant to let this frost thaw me-
Apart
